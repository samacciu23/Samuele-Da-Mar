# Hello everybody!
My name is Samuele Da Mar and I'm an aspiring Software Engineer.

A little bit about me:
🏫In high school my favourite subjects were Maths and Physics as they could describe the world in an analytical way.
📖I'm studying towards a Computer Science degree at the University of Greenwich.
💻I'm always learning about new technologies and programming languages.

🐍Python is my favourite programming language as it's the first one I learned.
🚩I'd love to build something, like an app, that could improve people's everyday life!
