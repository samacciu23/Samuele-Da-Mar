# Hello everybody! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px">
My name is Samuele Da Mar and I'm an aspiring Software Engineer.

A little bit about me:<br>
🏫In high school my favourite subjects were Maths and Physics as they could describe the world in an analytical way.<br>
📖I'm studying towards a Computer Science (Software Engineering) degree at the University of Greenwich.<br>
📈I'm always learning about new technologies and I like to stay up-to-date with the latest tech news.<br>
🐍Python is my favourite programming language as it's the first one I learned.<br>
🚩I love to build things that can improve people's everyday life.<br>
