# Hello everybody! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="20px" height="20px">
My name is Samuele Da Mar and I'm an aspiring Software Engineer.

A little bit about me:<br>
🏫In high school my favourite subjects were Maths and Physics as they could describe the world in an analytical way.<br>
📖I'm studying towards a Computer Science degree at the University of Greenwich.<br>
💻I'm always learning about new technologies and programming languages.<br>
🐍Python is my favourite programming language as it's the first one I learned.<br>
🚩I'd love to build something, like an app, that could improve people's everyday life!<br>

📈I'm periodically challenging myself and my friends with some coding problems from [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/problems?show_solved=on&show_tried=on&show_untried=on).
